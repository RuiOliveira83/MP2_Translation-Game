## Features

This website has 2 pages: **Home** and **Game**. Both pages share the same **Header**.

The **Header** has 2 Modals:
- a modal with a contact form where the user can leave a message or suggestion;
- a modal with the game rules.


The **Home** page is where the user can select the game mode.
The easy mode has 4 different options: Portuguese, Swedish, French and German.
The hard game mode has only one option: Random, where the language will be randomly selected for each new word.

The **Game** page includes a section with the score, the top score and the timer. Below that there is the word to be translated.
After that, there is information about the mode selected. At the bottom of the game area, there are 4 different words, one of 
them will be the correct translation.

![Responsiveness](readme-images/responsiveness.png)

The website structure adapts well to all used screen size.

### Functionality of the website
The responsiveness of all pages was tested:
- the Game Name on the top left corner returns you to the home page;
- the "Tell me what you think" modal is working and, when clicked, a working message box is shown;
- the "How to Play" modal is working and, when clicked, shows the game's rules;
- the buttons to select the game mode are working properly;
- the timer starts when the player starts to play the game;
- the score is working properly: increases the score for every correct answer and decreases the score for every wrong answer. It also starts at 0 points when the player starts a new game;
- the top score is working properly, it keeps the higher score when the player starts a new game;
- the words randomly selected are showing properly.

### Browser compatibility
The appearance and responsiveness of the website was tested with good results in 4 different web browsers: Microsoft Edge,
Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera. This website is not compatible with Internet Explorer because it uses promises that are not supported by IE.
